# Code Review Skill

Assess code quality and provide structured feedback.

## When This Skill Activates

- After code has been written or modified
- User explicitly asks for code review
- TDD skill invokes review in autonomous mode
- User says "review this", "check this code", "code review"

## Review Scope

| Scope | When | What to Review |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **Changed files** (default) | Normal reviews | Files modified in current cycle |
| **Related files** | User says "review with context" | Changed files + their imports/dependents |
| **Specific files** | User names files | Only the specified files |

## Threshold Levels

User can specify threshold:
- `review strict` - report everything
- `review normal` - report significant issues (default)
- `review relaxed` - report blockers only

### What Each Threshold Reports

| Category | Strict | Normal | Relaxed |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Blockers** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Warnings** | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Suggestions** | Yes | No | No |

## Finding Categories

### Blockers (Must Fix)

Issues that prevent the code from working correctly or safely:

- Failing tests
- Compilation errors
- Security vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, secrets in code)
- Null pointer risks without handling
- Resource leaks (unclosed connections, streams)
- Race conditions
- Breaking API contracts

### Warnings (Should Fix)

Issues that work but violate good practices:

- Code duplication (DRY violation)
- Poor naming (unclear intent)
- Long methods (> 20 lines)
- Too many parameters (> 3)
- Missing error handling
- Violations of SOLID principles
- Test coverage gaps
- Magic numbers/strings

### Suggestions (Nice to Have)

Minor improvements:

- Style inconsistencies
- Slightly better naming options
- Minor simplifications
- Documentation opportunities
- Performance micro-optimizations

## Review Process

1. **Identify scope** - what files to review
2. **Read the code** - understand intent and implementation
3. **Check against standards** - use `docs/context/conventions.md`
4. **Categorize findings** - blockers, warnings, suggestions
5. **Present structured output**

## Output Format

Present findings in this structure:

```markdown
## Code Review: [threshold] mode

### Scope
- file1.java (modified)
- file2.java (modified)

### Blockers (X found)
1. **[File:Line]** Description of blocker
   - Why it's a problem
   - Suggested fix

### Warnings (X found)
1. **[File:Line]** Description of warning
   - Why it matters
   - Suggested improvement

### Suggestions (X found)
1. **[File:Line]** Description of suggestion

### Summary
- Blockers: X
- Warnings: X
- Suggestions: X
- **Verdict**: [PASS / NEEDS ATTENTION / BLOCKED]
```

### Verdict Logic

| Verdict | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| **PASS** | No blockers, no warnings |
| **NEEDS ATTENTION** | No blockers, has warnings |
| **BLOCKED** | Has blockers |

## Standards Reference

When reviewing, check against:

### From `conventions.md`
- Package structure (`api/`, `internal/`, `web/`)
- Naming conventions (classes, methods, tests)
- Self-documenting code (no unnecessary comments)
- Clean code principles (small functions, single responsibility)

### From `testing.md`
- Test structure (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- Test naming (`should<Expected>_when<Condition>`)
- Single assertion per test (one logical concept)
- No testing implementation details

### Security Checklist
- No secrets in code
- Input validation at boundaries
- Parameterized queries (no SQL injection)
- Output encoding (no XSS)
- Proper authentication/authorization checks

## Integration with TDD Skill

When invoked by TDD autonomous mode:

1. Review skill receives the threshold level
2. Performs review on changed files
3. Returns findings
4. TDD skill decides to interrupt or continue based on threshold rules:
   - Strict: interrupt on any finding
   - Normal: interrupt on blockers or warnings
   - Relaxed: interrupt on blockers only

## Standalone Usage

User can invoke directly:

| Command | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| "review this code" | Normal threshold, changed files |
| "review strict" | Strict threshold, changed files |
| "review with context" | Normal threshold, related files |
| "review src/main/java/..." | Normal threshold, specific file |

## Key Principles

- **Be helpful, not pedantic** - focus on meaningful improvements
- **Explain why** - don't just flag, explain the impact
- **Suggest fixes** - provide actionable guidance
- **Respect context** - consider the codebase style and constraints
- **Prioritize** - blockers first, then warnings, then suggestions
